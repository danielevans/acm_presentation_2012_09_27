## ACM Programming Problems! ##

## Be Prepared ##
  + Know your language.
  + If you are using a compiled language, have a makefile written and printed to take with you.
  + Know how to get input from STDIN and print to STDOUT
  + Walk in with a "template" program printed out that can simply be re-typed in and used as a template to start all your others

## DONT PANIC ##
  + Under No Circumstances listen to Vogon poetry
  + The problems are often written to look scarier than they really are
  + Look for problems which may be very simple to solve or use algorithms you know well
  + Math is your friend, not food

## Divide et impera ##
  + You have a team, each of you have different skills, USE THEM
  + Split up into maverick and a pair on problems where it makes sense
  + Several problems will be easy enough for a single person to hack out alone, on paper
  + if someone is struggling and consuming computer time trying to debug PRINT OUT THE PROGRAM and debug on paper when another program is ready to be typed

## Code to Joy ##
  + You are using a kind of Test Driven Development, embrace it
  + Test against all example cases given in the problem
  + Add test cases to test the problems limits and extremes
  + use meaningful variable names (this is far more important than you might think)
  + Balance your approach between quick hacks and debuggable code
  + Elegance is not required
